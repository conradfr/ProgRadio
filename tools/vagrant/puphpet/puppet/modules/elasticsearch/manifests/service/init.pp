# This class exists to coordinate all service management related actions,
# functionality and logical units in a central place.
#
# *Note*: "service" is the Puppet term and type for background processes
# in general and is used in a platform-independent way. E.g. "service" means
# "daemon" in relation to Unix-like systems.
#
# @param ensure
#   Controls if the managed resources shall be `present` or
#   `absent`. If set to `absent`, the managed software packages will being
#   uninstalled and any traces of the packages will be purged as well as
#   possible. This may include existing configuration files (the exact
#   behavior is provider). This is thus destructive and should be used with
#   care.
#
# @param init_defaults
#   Defaults file content in hash representation
#
# @param init_defaults_file
#   Defaults file as puppet resource
#
# @param init_template
#   Service file as a template
#
# @param status
#   Defines the status of the service. If set to `enabled`, the service is
#   started and will be enabled at boot time. If set to `disabled`, the
#   service is stopped and will not be started at boot time. If set to `running`,
#   the service is started but will not be enabled at boot time. You may use
#   this to start a service on the first Puppet run instead of the system startup.
#   If set to `unmanaged`, the service will not be started at boot time and Puppet
#   does not care whether the service is running or not. For example, this may
#   be useful if a cluster management software is used to decide when to start
#   the service plus assuring it is running on the desired node.
